# University-project-timeline
The project was created for the purpose of university coursework.

## Overview
Idea was to create platform that let users create their own timelines.
#### Project objectives:
- Only users who are owners of a given timeline can edit them (CRUD operations), but everyone can view them on the page.
- Events can be grouped by categories.
- The event category has to have the option to set a card color.
- The platform has the option to print a given timeline, which is available for everyone.
- Clicking on a timeline event should display full event description.
